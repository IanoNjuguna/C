# The C Programming Language

## Description of this Repository

This repository contains the notes that I have taken while learning the C Programming Language from various sources over the years.

## An introduction to the C Programming Language

To begin with, programming is the process by which you tell hardware what to do. This process is done by writing a program(software).

The C language was developed in 1972 at AT&T Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie. It combined features from the B and BCPL programming languages but also mixed in a bit of the Pascal language.

## Reasons to learn the C Language

### Most Programming Languages have C Pedigree

Almost all popular programming languages are built on top of the C programming language e.g: 
    *C++
    *C#
    *Objective-C
    *Python
    *Ruby
    *Java
    *Lua
    *JavaScript
The languages are libraries built in C code.

### It is important for embedded programming
