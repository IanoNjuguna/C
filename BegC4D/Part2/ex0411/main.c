int main()

    printf("I have been a stranger in a strange land\n");
    //                                                      getchar();
    return 0;
}

// I commented out getchar(); 
// When I run this code on Code::Blocks, it runs in less than a second
// but for some reason, the source code takes longer to run on VS Code(more than 10 minutes) 
// presumably, it's because of the getchar() function. I don't know why so.
// Hopefully, I'll find out why as I continue my journey. Any help will be appreciated.
